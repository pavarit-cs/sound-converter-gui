# Sound Converter GUI

A simple desktop application built with Python Tkinter and pydub for converting audio files between WAV, MP3, and M4A formats.

## Features

* Convert audio files between WAV, MP3, and M4A.
* User-friendly graphical interface.
* Automatic detection of FFmpeg in system PATH for easy setup.

## Requirements

To run this application, you need:

* Python 3.x
* `tkinter` (usually comes with Python installation)
* `pydub` library
* `FFmpeg` (a powerful multimedia framework)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/sound-converter-gui.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/sound-converter-gui.git)
    cd sound-converter-gui
    ```
    (Replace `YourUsername` and `sound-converter-gui` with your actual GitHub username and repository name)

2.  **Install pydub:**
    ```bash
    pip install pydub
    ```

3.  **Install FFmpeg:**
    FFmpeg is a prerequisite for `pydub`. Please install FFmpeg on your system and ensure it's added to your system's `PATH` environment variable.
    * **Windows:** [FFmpeg Download (gyan.dev or BtbN)](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) - Extract and add `path/to/ffmpeg/bin` to system PATH.
    * **macOS:** `brew install ffmpeg` (using Homebrew)
    * **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):** `sudo apt install ffmpeg`

## How to Run

1.  Make sure all requirements are installed.
2.  Run the main application script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

1.  Click "Select your file" to choose an audio file (WAV, MP3, M4A).
2.  Select your desired output format from the dropdown menu (WAV, MP3, M4A).
3.  The output file path will be suggested in the same directory as the input file.
4.  Click "Convert" to start the conversion process.
5.  A success or error message will be displayed.

## Troubleshooting (Common Issues)

* **"ERROR: FFmpeg executable not found":** Ensure FFmpeg is installed and its `bin` directory is correctly added to your system's PATH. Restart your terminal/IDE after adding to PATH.
* **"ERROR: Could not decode input file":** The input file might be corrupted or in an unsupported format.
* **M4A conversion issues:** Ensure your FFmpeg build supports AAC encoding. The code attempts to use the default `aac` codec.
